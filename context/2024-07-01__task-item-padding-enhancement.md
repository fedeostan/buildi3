# TaskItem Padding Enhancement

## Task Description

Updated the TaskItem component to match Figma design specifications by adjusting padding and spacing between title and due date.

## Changes Made

1. Increased the vertical padding from `spacing.xs` (8px) to `spacing.sm` (16px) to match the Figma design
2. Improved spacing between task title and due date from 2px to 4px (`spacing.xs/2`) for better visual hierarchy

## Design System Usage

- Used existing spacing tokens: `spacing.sm` and `spacing.xs`
- Maintained use of existing color tokens
- No hardcoded values were introduced

## Files Modified

- `/Buildi3App/components/ui/TaskItem/styles.ts`

## Lessons Learned

- Always reference Figma for precise spacing values before implementing components
- Use fractions of spacing tokens (like `spacing.xs/2`) when you need smaller increments that aren't directly available in the theme system
- When adjusting spacing in existing components, verify both the visual appearance and mobile responsiveness

## Next Steps

- Consider adding this intermediate spacing value (`spacing.xs/2` or 4px) to the spacing system if it's used frequently
- Review other components in the TaskList and UpcomingTaskWidget to ensure consistent spacing
