# Upcoming Task Widget Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the Upcoming Task Widget component, a flexible widget for displaying task lists with filtering capabilities.

## Components Created

1. **TaskItem**: A pressable component that displays individual task information with title, due date and chevron icon.
2. **TaskList**: A component that displays a collection of TaskItems with empty state handling and maximum limit.
3. **UpcomingTaskWidget**: The main widget that combines a Widget base with TaskList and filtering functionality.

## Key Learnings

### Dependencies

- **date-fns**: Required for date formatting and comparison. Must be installed with `npm install date-fns` before using components.
- **Package Installation Location**: Make sure to install dependencies in the Buildi3App directory, not at the project root. The project structure has its own package.json file in the Buildi3App subdirectory.

### Structure

- Used atomic design principles: TaskItem (molecule) → TaskList (organism) → UpcomingTaskWidget (specialized organism)
- Followed project's component file structure with separate files for types, styles, component implementation, and documentation

### Widget Configuration

- Supports different states (1-5 tasks) through a `maxTasks` property
- Filter button displays a bottom sheet with period options (Today, This week, This month, All)
- Optional "View All" button can be shown/hidden

### Error Resolution

- Fixed text rendering issue in Widget component (strings must be wrapped in Typography/Text components)
- Installed missing date-fns dependency
- Fixed dependency resolution by installing packages in correct directory (Buildi3App) and restarting with clean cache (`npx expo start -c`)

## Test Implementation

Created a test screen at `/app/project-widget-test.tsx` that demonstrates different configurations:

- Widgets with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 tasks
- Empty state
- Widget without filter

## Future Improvements

- Add task completion functionality
- Consider using an actual bottom sheet library like `@gorhom/bottom-sheet` for more native feeling
- Implement animations for task completion/removal
- Add drag-to-reorder capabilities
