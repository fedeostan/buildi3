### Context folder

Stores structured learnings the LLM generates after each task. Each entry is a short, actionable note that improves future tasks.

Files

- `index.md`: Table of contents and taxonomy
- `_template.md`: Required headings for new entries
- `YYYY-MM-DD__task-slug.md`: One file per task with concise learnings

Usage

1. Before work: read `index.md` and open relevant linked entries.
2. After work: duplicate `_template.md`, fill it, name as `YYYY-MM-DD__task-slug.md`, and add it to `index.md` under the right category.
