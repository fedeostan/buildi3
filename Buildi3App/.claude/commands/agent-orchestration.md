```

### Phase 2: Execution Strategy üöÄ

**Single Agent Execution:**
```
Task tool with:
- subagent_type: "[selected-agent-type]"
- description: "[concise-task-description]"  
- prompt: "[comprehensive-context-with-specific-requirements]"
```

**Parallel Agent Execution (When Applicable):**
```
// Execute multiple agents simultaneously for independent tasks
Task tool with subagent_type: "qa-testing-specialist" (for testing)
Task tool with subagent_type: "data-architecture-agent" (for database)
Task tool with subagent_type: "research-validation-specialist" (for validation)
```

**Sequential Agent Execution (For Dependencies):**
```
1. Research/Analysis Agent ‚Üí Gather requirements
2. Architecture Agent ‚Üí Design solution  
3. Implementation Agent ‚Üí Execute development
4. QA Agent ‚Üí Validate and test
```

### Phase 3: Context Preparation üìã

**Essential Context for Agents:**
```markdown
## Project Context
- Epic Status: Epic 1-2 complete, Epic 3 ready
- Architecture: React Native + Supabase (15-table schema)
- Security: RLS with role-based permissions
- Components: 80+ with atomic design system

## Task Requirements
[Specific requirements and acceptance criteria]

## Constraints
- Must follow component reuse analysis
- Must use design tokens (no hard-coded values)
- Must implement defensive programming
- Must avoid known anti-patterns from MASTER_LESSONS.md

## Success Criteria
[Measurable outcomes and deliverables]

## Related Context
[Links to relevant documentation and context files]
```

**Agent-Specific Context:**
- **QA Testing**: Include error logs, reproduction steps, expected behavior
- **Data Architecture**: Include schema context, query patterns, performance requirements  
- **Research Validation**: Include specific questions, decision criteria, alternatives
- **General Purpose**: Include file patterns, analysis scope, cross-references

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance & Follow-up üîç

**Agent Output Validation:**
- [ ] **Deliverables match requirements** 
- [ ] **Follows established patterns** from MASTER_LESSONS.md
- [ ] **Avoids known anti-patterns**
- [ ] **Includes appropriate testing/validation**
- [ ] **Documentation is updated** where relevant

**Context Documentation Update:**
```markdown
## Agent Orchestration Result
**Date**: [current-date]
**Task**: [task-description] 
**Agent Used**: [agent-type]
**Outcome**: [success/issues/lessons]
**Pattern**: [reusable-pattern-if-applicable]
```

**Follow-up Actions:**
- Update MASTER_LESSONS.md if new patterns discovered
- Create context documentation for significant insights  
- Route additional tasks to other agents if needed
- Validate integration with existing codebase
