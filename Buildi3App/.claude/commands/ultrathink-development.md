## Command Implementation

**I need to approach this development task with deep analysis and systematic thinking.**

### Phase 1: Ultrathink Analysis ðŸ§ 

**Problem Understanding:**
- What exactly is being requested? (Parse requirements thoroughly)
- What are the constraints and dependencies?
- What existing patterns apply from MASTER_LESSONS.md?
- What are the potential failure modes and edge cases?

**Context Assessment:**
- Review relevant sections of MASTER_LESSONS.md for anti-patterns
- Check component reuse analysis for existing solutions
- Identify appropriate specialist agent for this task type
- Assess MCP tool requirements (Figma, Supabase, Context7)

**Architecture Impact Analysis:**
- How does this change affect the overall system?
- What security implications exist (RLS, permissions)?
- What performance considerations apply?
- What testing strategies are needed?

### Phase 2: Solution Design ðŸŽ¯

**Pattern Identification:**
- What proven patterns apply to this problem?
- What anti-patterns must be avoided?
- What defensive programming measures are needed?
- How can this solution be made reusable?

**Technical Approach:**
- What is the minimal viable implementation?
- What incremental steps can validate the approach?
- What rollback plan exists if issues arise?
- What documentation needs to be created/updated?

**Quality Assurance:**
- What test cases are needed?
- What edge cases require validation?
- What error handling is required?
- What logging/debugging support is needed?

### Phase 3: Implementation Strategy ðŸ“‹

**Agent Selection:**
Based on the analysis, route to the most appropriate specialist:
- **QA Testing Specialist**: For bug resolution and testing
- **Data Architecture Agent**: For database/schema changes  
- **Mobile App Architect**: For React Native architecture
- **General Purpose Agent**: For multi-file analysis
- **Domain Experts**: For specialized knowledge areas

**Execution Plan:**
1. **Preparation**: Gather all necessary context and requirements
2. **Implementation**: Execute with chosen specialist agent
3. **Validation**: Test thoroughly with edge cases
4. **Documentation**: Update relevant context and lessons
5. **Integration**: Ensure seamless integration with existing patterns

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Problem solved using established patterns
- [ ] No new anti-patterns introduced
- [ ] Comprehensive testing completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code follows defensive programming principles
