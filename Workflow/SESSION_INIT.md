# Buildi3 Project Context Initialization Protocol

**PURPOSE**: This file triggers an intelligent context acquisition workflow that brings any Claude Code session up to full project understanding in seconds.

## üöÄ INITIALIZATION TRIGGER

When starting a new Claude Code session on Buildi3, execute this command:

```bash
# Quick project context acquisition
echo "üéØ Initializing Buildi3 context - reading core files..." && \
cat CLAUDE.md && \
echo "üìã Project status loaded. Ready for agent workflow."
```

## üìñ CRITICAL READING LIST (Execute in Order)

### Phase 1: Foundation Context (MANDATORY - Read First)
```
1. /Users/federicoostan/buildi3/CLAUDE.md - Project rules & MCP servers
2. /Users/federicoostan/buildi3/Planning/Epic3_Handoff_Documentation.md - Current implementation status  
3. /Users/federicoostan/buildi3/context/component-reuse-analysis.md - UI patterns & limitations
4. /Users/federicoostan/buildi3/context/epic1-implementation-complete.md - Backend implementation
```

### Phase 2: Architecture Deep-Dive (Agent-Driven)
```
5. /Users/federicoostan/buildi3/Buildi3App/lib/supabase/types.ts - Database schema (15 tables)
6. /Users/federicoostan/buildi3/Buildi3App/contexts/AuthContext.tsx - Auth implementation
7. /Users/federicoostan/buildi3/Buildi3App/app/(tabs)/tasks/index.tsx - Task management UI
8. /Users/federicoostan/buildi3/Buildi3App/components/TaskSection.tsx - Core task component
```

## ü§ñ INTELLIGENT AGENT WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Context Agent Activation
```
Use Task tool with subagent_type: "general-purpose"
Description: "Project context acquisition"
Prompt: "Read the 8 critical files listed in SESSION_INIT.md and provide:
1. Current project status summary
2. Key architectural decisions
3. Available MCP tools and their purposes  
4. Critical issues that need immediate attention
5. Next recommended actions based on project state"
```

### Step 2: Specialized Agent Selection
Based on the task at hand, automatically route to appropriate agents:

**For UI/Component Work:**
- `mobile-app-architect` - React Native architectural guidance
- `construction-domain-expert` - Construction workflow validation

**For Database/Backend Work:**  
- `data-architecture-agent` - Database design and optimization
- `localization-compliance-agent` - Portuguese compliance requirements

**For Features/PRDs:**
- `prd-architect` - Feature specification and requirements
- `ai-orchestration-engineer` - AI workflow implementation

**For Quality/Testing:**
- `qa-testing-specialist` - Feature testing and validation  
- `research-validation-specialist` - Technical research and verification

### Step 3: Context Validation
Execute this validation sequence:
```typescript
// Quick context check - should be answerable immediately after init
1. "What MCP servers are available?" (Answer: Figma, Supabase, Context7, IDE)
2. "What's the current Epic status?" (Answer: Epic 1&2 complete, Epic 3 ready)  
3. "What's the main critical issue?" (Answer: Enum format mismatches)
4. "Which UI components are ready?" (Answer: 80+ including TaskSection, ProjectItem)
```

## üìä PROJECT STATE SNAPSHOT (As of Sept 2025)

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATIONS
- **Epic 1**: 15-table Supabase schema (exceeds 3-table PRD)
- **Epic 2**: Full authentication system (signup ‚Üí verify ‚Üí login)
- **UI Framework**: 80+ React Native components ready
- **Architecture**: Clean, production-ready codebase

### üö® CRITICAL ISSUES (Fix Before Any Work)
1. **Enum Mismatches**: Frontend uses `kebab-case`, DB uses `snake_case`
2. **Icon Color Format**: `Blue Light` (frontend) vs `blue_light` (database)
3. **Security Config**: Function security warnings need addressing

### üéØ NEXT PHASE READY
- **Epic 3**: Profile & Onboarding System Integration
- **Target**: Connect 80+ UI components to 15-table backend
- **Goal**: Launch-ready construction management MVP

## üõ† MCP TOOLS AVAILABLE

### Core Development Tools
- **Figma Dev Mode**: Design-to-code generation, asset management
- **Supabase**: Database operations, migrations, edge functions
- **Context7**: Up-to-date library documentation and references
- **IDE**: Diagnostics, code execution, debugging

### Specialized Agents (Use Frequently!)
- **mobile-app-architect**: React Native/Expo architectural guidance
- **data-architecture-agent**: Database design and real-time sync
- **construction-domain-expert**: Construction industry workflow validation
- **prd-architect**: Feature specification and requirement analysis
- **qa-testing-specialist**: Comprehensive testing and validation
- **ai-orchestration-engineer**: AI workflow design and optimization

## ‚ö° RAPID CONTEXT COMMANDS

### Quick Status Check
```bash
# Get current git status and recent commits
git status --short && git log --oneline -5

# Check Supabase connection
npx supabase status
```

### Instant Architecture Overview
```bash
# Core file structure
find Buildi3App -name "*.tsx" -type f | grep -E "(contexts|lib|components)" | head -10
```

### MCP Server Validation
```bash
# Verify MCP servers are active (Claude will show available tools)
echo "MCP servers should be visible in Claude Code tool list"
```

## üß† CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION RULES

### DO - Context Best Practices
- ‚úÖ Use subagents early and often to preserve main context
- ‚úÖ Read this file first in every new session
- ‚úÖ Route specialized tasks to appropriate agents immediately
- ‚úÖ Use `/clear` between major context shifts
- ‚úÖ Leverage MCP tools instead of manual file reading
- ‚úÖ Reference existing patterns in `context/` folder

### DON'T - Context Anti-Patterns  
- ‚ùå Assume any context from previous sessions
- ‚ùå Read random files without following the initialization sequence
- ‚ùå Implement new patterns without checking existing components
- ‚ùå Skip agent usage - they preserve context and provide expertise
- ‚ùå Ignore the critical issues list - fix those first
- ‚ùå Create new files without understanding existing architecture

## üé≠ AGENT UTILIZATION STRATEGY

### When to Use Each Agent Type

**Immediate Usage (Start of Session):**
```
1. general-purpose: Project exploration and context building
2. qa-testing-specialist: Validate current implementation status
3. research-validation-specialist: Verify technical decisions
```

**Feature Development:**
```
1. prd-architect: Define requirements and acceptance criteria
2. mobile-app-architect: Design React Native implementation
3. data-architecture-agent: Plan database integration
4. construction-domain-expert: Validate construction workflows
```

**Quality Assurance:**
```
1. qa-testing-specialist: Test features and validate requirements
2. research-validation-specialist: Research best practices
```

**Specialized Tasks:**
```
1. ai-orchestration-engineer: AI workflow implementation  
2. localization-compliance-agent: Portuguese/EU compliance
```

## üöÄ SUCCESS METRICS

After executing this initialization protocol, you should be able to:

1. ‚úÖ Explain the current project status and architecture
2. ‚úÖ Identify the top 3 critical issues that need fixing
3. ‚úÖ Know which MCP servers are available and their purposes
4. ‚úÖ Route any development task to the appropriate specialist agent
5. ‚úÖ Understand the Epic 3 requirements and next steps
6. ‚úÖ Navigate the codebase structure and key components

## üìû EMERGENCY CONTEXT RECOVERY

If context is lost or corrupted mid-session:
```bash
# Reset and reinitialize
echo "üîÑ Context recovery initiated" && cat /Users/federicoostan/buildi3/Workflow/SESSION_INIT.md
```

Then execute the Phase 1 reading list and context validation sequence.

---

**REMEMBER**: This protocol is designed for maximum efficiency. Follow the sequence, use the agents, and you'll have full project context in under 2 minutes of session time.
