# ðŸš€ NEW SESSION START - READ THIS FILE FIRST

**ACTION REQUIRED**: Read this file completely, then execute the initialization sequence below.

## âš¡ INSTANT CONTEXT PROTOCOL

**Step 1**: Read the comprehensive initialization guide:
```
/Users/federicoostan/buildi3/Workflow/SESSION_INIT.md
```

**Step 2**: Execute this agent command to gain full project context:
```
Use Task tool with:
- subagent_type: "general-purpose"  
- description: "Buildi3 context bootstrap"
- prompt: "Execute the SESSION_INIT.md protocol. Read the Phase 1 critical files, provide the 4 context validation answers, and summarize project status, architecture, MCP tools, critical issues, and next steps."
```

**Step 3**: Validate context acquisition with these questions:
- What MCP servers are available? 
- What's the current Epic status?
- What's the main critical issue?
- Which UI components are ready?

## ðŸŽ¯ EXPECTED OUTCOME

After reading SESSION_INIT.md and running the general-purpose agent, you should have:

âœ… **Full Project Understanding**: Epic 1 & 2 complete, Epic 3 ready  
âœ… **Architecture Clarity**: React Native + Supabase with 15-table schema  
âœ… **Critical Issue Awareness**: Enum format mismatches need fixing first  
âœ… **Tool Mastery**: Know all available MCP servers and specialist agents  
âœ… **Next Steps**: Clear action plan for continuing development  

## ðŸ”§ IF CONTEXT ACQUISITION FAILS
